Worship Foundry has hired you to create a one page website for their new product. The objective of the page is to showcase the product features and benefits while capturing emails so they can market to users once their product is available. They have no specific content requirements, simply to inform and excite users about their upcoming product.

Their audience is Worship Leaders and Worship Team members. They have no current branding and are giving you the creative freedom to play with their brand.
